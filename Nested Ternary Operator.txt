A ternary operator evaluates the test condition and executes a block of code based on the result of the condition.
In Java, the ternary operator can be used to replace certain types of if...else statements. 

It is also possible to use one ternary operator inside another ternary operator. It is called the nested ternary operator in Java.

Its syntax is:
condition ? expression1 : expression2;

Here, condition is evaluated and if condition is true, expression1 is executed.
And, if condition is false, expression2 is executed.
The ternary operator takes 3 operands (condition, expression1, and expression2). Hence, the name ternary operator.

Example:

public class NestedTernaryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        // Nested ternary operator to check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or neither
        String result = (number % 2 == 0) ? ((number % 3 == 0) ? "Divisible by both 2 and 3" : "Divisible by 2 only") : ((number % 3 == 0) ? "Divisible by 3 only" : "Not divisible by either 2 or 3");

        System.out.println("The number " + number + " is " + result + ".");
    }
}


Output: The number 10 is Divisible by 2 only.
