Code Optimization 

There are two types of methods in Java:

1. Predefined Method
In Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as the standard library method or built-in method. We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any point.
